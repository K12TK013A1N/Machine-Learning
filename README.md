# MACHINE LEARNING FROM SCRATCH 🧠💻
In this repo. i'll be uploading all the contents and projects as i learn machine learning from scratch. Resources Recommened by: [How I'd learn ML in 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUmagAluXpk)
## Steps Summarized :-

As of now, i already have an idea of first three steps so i'll start from first course itself.

i.e [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
